PROjects Installation Guide
This document will serve as the guide on how to install the PROjects app.

Backend:
1. Clone the repository down to your computer - https://github.com/HannuOpperman/PROjectsBackend.git (main branch)
2. Navigate into the folder and run this command to install all the required external packages - npm install
3. Start the app by running the following command - node app.js

I suggest completing this step before moving on.
The backend app will be hosted on localhost:3000 by default, if you change this in the TODO's you need to update the frontend too at the TODO's


Frontend:
1. Clone the repository down to your computer - https://github.com/HannuOpperman/PROjects.git (master branch)
2. Navigate into the folder and run this command to install all the required external packages - npm install
3. Start the app by running the following command - ng serve

Additional Frontend Notes:
The frontend app will be hosted on localhost:4200 by default

You should be ready to go now.
